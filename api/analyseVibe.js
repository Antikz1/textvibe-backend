    **User's Goal:**
    The user's primary goal for this interaction is: "${goal}". Tailor your analysis and suggestions to help them achieve this.

    **Conversation Analysis Instructions:**
    Analyze the following conversation from the user's perspective (they are "Me").
    1.  **Strategic Analysis:** Write a concise paragraph (2-4 sentences) explaining the dynamic of the conversation. Incorporate psychological principles (e.g., scarcity, social proof, power dynamics). This is the 'strategicAnalysis'.
    2.  **Power Dynamic:** State who has the upper hand or if it's balanced. This is the 'powerDynamic'.
    3.  **Scores:** Provide a 'confidenceScore' and 'interestScore' from the other person's perspective (scale of 1-10).
    4.  **Strategic Replies:** Generate an array of exactly 3 distinct suggested replies. Each reply object in the array must have these keys: 'title' (a catchy name for the strategy), 'text' (the suggested reply), 'reason' (why this approach is effective), 'riskLevel' (Low, Medium, or High), and 'potentialOutcome' (the likely result of this reply).

    **Output Format:**
    Respond ONLY with a single, minified JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
    Example Format: {"strategicAnalysis":"...","powerDynamic":"...","confidenceScore":7,"interestScore":8,"suggestedReplies":[{"title":"...","text":"...","reason":"...","riskLevel":"...","potentialOutcome":"..."}, ...]}

    **Conversation to Analyze:**
